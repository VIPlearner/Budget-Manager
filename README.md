For implementing data persistence in the Budget Manager app, I chose to use Room database, which is an Android Architecture Component that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust and efficient database operations.

I chose room database because of its Flow and LiveData integration making integration with the UI smooth
Also It is easily scalable especially with the versioning system in place
It is also easy to use and understand
